        About me
      </Typography>
      <Typography variant="body1" gutterBottom>
        Effective web design is judged by the users. A site should always look
        great but its not just about how good it looks, but how easy it is to
        use. I believe in the importance of good planning and understanding what
        visitors want. Translating this via wireframes into good code, I always
        try to deliver a high quality user experience â€“ mobile-friendly,
        accessible, fast, navigable and enjoyable to browse.

        I've spent the last 8 years as a front-end web developer at two
        medium-sized web design companies, which means I'm used to working on
        multiple projects simultaneously and delivering (on schedule) web
        applications that fully meet the needs of their clients and visitors.
